<h1>Code Coverage in Elixir</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Elixir has access to code coverage tools built into Erlang. This is a quick guide on how to use them.</p>

<p>The erlang tools for collecting and analyzing code coverage are documented <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/apps/tools/cover_chapter.html">here</a></p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Let's setup a new project to play with.</p>

```
mix new calculator
```

Now let's add some code and tests to give us some partial coverage.

`test/calculator.exs`
```elixir
defmodule Calculator do
  def add(a, b) do
    a + b
  end

  def multiply(a, b) do
    a * b
  end
end
```

`test/calculator_test.exs`
```elixir
defmodule CalculatorTest do
  use ExUnit.Case

  describe "add/2" do
    test "2 plus 3 is 5" do
      assert Calculator.add(2, 3) == 5
    end

    test "2 plus 2 is 4" do
      assert Calculator.add(2, 2) == 4
    end
  end
end
```

Now that we have some code and tests, let's see how we're doing on coverage

```
➜  mix test --cover
Cover compiling modules ...
..
Finished in 0.01 seconds (0.00s async, 0.01s sync)
2 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 484188

Generating cover results ...

Percentage | Module
-----------|--------------------------
    50.00% | Calculator
-----------|--------------------------
    50.00% | Total

Coverage test failed, threshold not met:

    Coverage:   50.00%
    Threshold:  90.00%

Generated HTML coverage results in "cover" directory

➜  echo $?         
3
```

We can see the threshold was not met and exited with exit code 3. Which is useful
when running in a CI environment to enforce coverage.

We can lower the threshold for coverage by updating the `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
def project do
  [
    app: :calculator,
    version: "0.1.0",
    elixir: "~> 1.14",
    start_permanent: Mix.env() == :prod,
    deps: deps(),
    test_coverage: [summary: [threshold: 50]]
  ]
end
```

Now we can run the tests again and see that we pass the coverage requirements.

There's also an html file generated that we can open to see the coverage line by line.

```
open cover/Elixir.Calculator.html
```

We can easily see that we're missing coverage on the `multiply/2` function.
