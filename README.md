### Airpnp
__Co-Founder (2014)__

The idea for Airpnp came while having drinks at a bar during Mardi Gras. It was a requirement that the patrons of the bar purchase a drink (be a paying customer) in order to use the restroom. This started a conversation about an idea to create an "Airbnb for bathrooms". Host users of the app could make there restrooms available while other users could find nearby bathrooms and pay per pee (or pooh) in the app. Users could even contact the hosts via anonymized text and voice chat through the app. We leverages api services from twilio and stripe to make it all happen.

## Bclip Productions
__Software Engineer (2002 - 2011)__

My introduction to software engineering was made possible through my job at Bclip. Bclip is a video production company that creates videos for businesses. My job was to deliver videos in various formats which included: interactive presentations on CDROM and DVD, touch screen kiosks meant for retail installation and tradeshow floors, streaming video embeddable on websites. This was my first job out of college and where I became interested in programming with my first language which was a language called Lingo from Macromedia Director.
