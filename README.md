# Experience

## Peek
__Senior Backend Engineer (2022 - 2025)__

Peek provides SaaS solutions for the experience industry, serving businesses such as ghost tours, zip line adventures, boat rentals, and other tourism/activity operators. As a senior backend engineer, I worked on the large-scale Elixir codebase powering the flagship Peek Pro platform, which processes millions of bookings annually. I also gained experience with Ember.js for frontend development and implemented comprehensive observability solutions using New Relic.

Key contributions and projects:

**Peek CoPilot** - Led the development of Peek CoPilot, an AI-powered business intelligence tool that transformed operational data into actionable insights. Created a pipeline to analyze and summarize customer reviews, extract sentiment patterns and provide partners with concrete improvement recommendations. Implemented advanced pricing intelligence that analyzed competitive market data to optimize pricing strategies, directly increasing partner revenue.

**Outbox Messaging** - Implemented a high-performance messaging outbox system with an optimized Elasticsearch indexing strategy enabling real-time search and retrieval across many services with massive message volumes. Featured a user interface for tracking communication history and scheduled messages that included the ability to search, preview, cancel, and resend messages.

**Digitally Signed Waivers** - Led the redesign and implementation of an enterprise-grade digital waiver system. Developed a flexible architecture that seamlessly integrated waivers with the booking process. Created a secure, legally-compliant signature system supporting both adult participants and minors with guardian approval. Implemented a robust storage and retrieval system ensuring waivers remained accessible for legal compliance.

**Reporting Platform** - Spearheaded the development of a next-generation business intelligence platform. Leveraged AlloyDB's advanced capabilities to design and implement a high-performance data warehouse. Created the backend GraphQL API to power a comprehensive suite of real-time analytics dashboards providing critical business insights with the ability to create customizable reporting templates to perform complex comparative analyses across time periods and business segments.

**Peek.com Search** - Architected a high-performance search and discovery system for Peek.com's consumer marketplace. Designed and implemented sophisticated Elasticsearch indexing strategies to aggregate data from multiple sources. Optimized search relevance algorithms to improve conversion rates and user satisfaction.

**Elasticsearch Framework** - Engineered an enterprise-grade Elasticsearch infrastructure framework that improved reliability and developer productivity. Designed and implemented a macro-based Elixir module system for configuring and managing multiple Elasticsearch indexes. Created an intelligent batching system for efficiently transforming database records into Elasticsearch documents. Implemented error handling with automatic retry mechanisms for failed indexing operations. Built safeguards including hot swap protection to ensure zero-downtime index rebuilds and prevent partial index states.

**Tipping System** - Implemented a tipping system integrated into the booking flow that increased partner revenue and guide satisfaction. Automated tip distribution to guides based on configurable rules. Included financial tracking and reporting for accounting compliance.

**Code Coverage Tool** - Created and open-sourced a GitHub Action that analyzes test coverage and highlights areas needing improvement through PR annotations. The tool features configurable thresholds and has been adopted by multiple teams to maintain code quality standards. ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/peek-travel/coverage-reporter))

GradSquare's mission was to bridge the gap between universities and industry. A centralized platform where employers/recruiters could easily find graduates from every university, and universities could get actionable insights on the market traction of their degree programs.

As the sole technologist for GradSquare, I was the graphic designer and software engineer. Below are some screenshots of the application that was created.

### Airpnp
__Co-Founder (2014)__

The idea for Airpnp came while having drinks at a bar during Mardi Gras. It was a requirement that the patrons of the bar purchase a drink (be a paying customer) in order to use the restroom. This started a conversation about an idea to create an "Airbnb for bathrooms". Host users of the app could make their restrooms available while other users could find nearby bathrooms and pay per pee (or pooh) in the app. Users could even contact the hosts via anonymized text and voice chat through the app. We leveraged API services from Twilio and Stripe to make it all happen.

## Bclip Productions
__Software Engineer (2002 - 2011)__

My introduction to software engineering was made possible through my job at Bclip. Bclip is a video production company that creates videos for businesses. My job was to deliver videos in various formats which included: interactive presentations on CDROM and DVD, touch screen kiosks meant for retail installation and tradeshow floors, streaming video embeddable on websites. This was my first job out of college and where I became interested in programming with my first language which was a language called Lingo from Macromedia Director.
